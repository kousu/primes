primes
======

Some doodles on trying to make factorials faster; this almost painfully naturally led to investigating prime sieves. I never got anywhere concrete, but I made some interesting observations on the (algebraic?) structures underlying sieving. See [presentation](presentation/) for my [SASMS](http://pmclub.uwaterloo.ca/?q=events) summary. It might not make any sense anymore, though.
