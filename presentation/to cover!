To cover:



order:
title
eros
sqthm
pythoncode + square improvement (from the original algorithm)
eros2 + point out the duplicate work
multihits booooooo
fancyfresh + point out that 3s can go by 6s + wtf 5s? wtf 7s? ... point out the cube theorem
cubetheorem -> doesn't help
diffs <-- THERE ARE PATTERNS HERE. The primes may seem random but their negative space is not.
loop graphs
 ->The circled bits ~= Unit Groups
U(n): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group_of_integers_modulo_n
define: lcm(k)
the recursive structure of these groups
 -> why there's exactly one to take out for each? I..don't know>

TODO:
-prime number theorem (n/ln(n))
-


future work:
-make it work!
-do p**4s matter?? (i actually did look at this a bit) / iterative method, somehow use newly found primes to find further primes?
-wtf why this weird pattern
