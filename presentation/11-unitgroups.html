<h3>Unit Groups</h3>

<p><u>Def'n</u>: U(n) is the group of units of modulo n. This is the set of all congruence-classes (~= integers, whatever) in mod n where all members are coprime to n.</p>

<p>e.g.
U(2) = [1]<br/>
U(3) = [1, 2]<br/>
U(4) = [1, 3]<br/>
U(5) = [1, 2, 3, 4]<br/>
U(6) = [1, 5]<br/>
U(7) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]<br/>
U(8) = [1, 3, 5, 7]<br/>
U(9) = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8]<br/>
U(10) = [1, 3, 7, 9]<br/>
U(11) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]<br/>
U(12) = [1, 5, 7, 11]<br/>
U(13) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]<br/>
U(14) = [1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13]<br/>
U(16) = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]<br/>
U(17) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]<br/>
U(18) = [1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]<br/>
U(33) = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 31, 32]<br/>
U(50) = [1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 23, 27, 29, 31, 33, 37, 39, 41, 43, 47, 49]<br/>
U(63) = [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 29, 31, 32, 34, 37, 38, 40, 41, 43, 44, 46, 47, 50, 52, 53, 55, 58, 59, 61, 62]<br/>
U(76) = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75]<br/>
U(86) = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85]<br/>
U(97) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96]<br/>

<p>Some things we know about these: the size of the unit group is ephi(n) where ephi is the euler-phi function. If n is prime, ephi(n) = n-1 because everything except n (aka 0) itself is coprime to n. If we have n factored into primes, then n=p^i * q^j * r^k, then ephi(n) = (p^i - p^(i-1))*(q^j - q^(j-1))*(r^k - r^(k-1))</p>
